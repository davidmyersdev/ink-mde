# ink-mde

A beautiful, modern, customizable Markdown editor powered by CodeMirror 6 and TypeScript.

Images can be previewed in-place. ![kitten](https://placekitten.com/2000/200)

Inline code (e.g. `const a = 10`) and code blocks are highlighted in-place.

```ts
// Write code with syntax highlighting.
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  return a + b
}
```

Stay *focused* on what you write instead of breaking concentration to check formatting.
